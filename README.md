# RxjsExamples

This project consists on a series of RxJs examples to show common use cases.

It's mostly focused in using the library without Angular, but it also contains some Angular examples with services and the async pipe.

## Run examples

Use ts-node to run all the examples in the `scripts` folder. You can use npx if you don't have it installed globally:

```sh
npx ts-node scripts/1-observables.ts
```

In each file you should uncomment the desired code block to run.

## Run Angular Example

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
